          Ahh I see what you mean 👌 — right now your sliced background
          (bg-1..5) and the real hero background are in the same layer, so the
          “real background” is always visible behind the slices. That makes it
          impossible to “reveal” it cleanly. The trick is: Don’t put the real
          background in the same wrapper. Instead, put the slices on top of a
          solid background (like black/white). After the slice animation
          finishes, either fade in the main background (e.g. one big image,
          gradient, or video) or remove the slices. Ahh I see what you mean 👌 —
